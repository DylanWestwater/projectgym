    <h1>Project Gym</h1>
    <h2>Here at project gym we know how confusing it is trying to research facts about the gym. 
        Wether your aim is to lose fat, gain muscle or both, the internet is crawling with people who are offering the next best 4 week plan to get you to look like a greek god or goddess.
    We prefer to take a different approach, with simple, easy to understand exercises, you can spend less time googling and more time lifting!</h2>
